# Workflow Process Service Samples

Workflow Process Service can be run in the Workflow Process Service Authoring environment or the Workflow Process Service Server environment. The authoring environment comes with IBMÂ® Business Automation Studio and allows you to create, maintain, and edit Business Automation Workflow. Both environments run Business Automation Workflow and have IBM Workplace as the front-end user interface. Each of these environments has the same prerequisites but they have unique Docker images.
